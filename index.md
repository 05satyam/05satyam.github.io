        <p>I'm <strong>Satyam Mittal</strong>, a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> who loves to code.</p>
        <p><strong>I believe in:</strong> Programming is thinking, not typing. With good technology comes great knowledge, and with the exponential growth in AI, daily reading is a must.</p>
        <p>I have 4 years of tech-industry work experience in developing, testing, and deploying large-scale software solutions.</p>
        <p>Completed my M.S. graduate degree in Computer Science at Fresno State, CA, where I worked on an innovative independent research thesis on Blindfolded Spider-Man Optimization: A Single-point Metaheuristic Suitable for Continuous and Discrete Space.
