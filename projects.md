# My Software Solutions, Live Projects, and Libraries

## M.S. Thesis: Blindfolded Spider-Man Optimization
**Topic**: Blindfolded Spider-Man Optimization: A Single-point Metaheuristic Suitable for Continuous and Discrete Space

- Developed a new metaheuristic algorithm based on Buggy-Pinball using high dimensional geometric math up to 20D.
- Tackled higher dimensional non-convex optimization problems.
- Applied metaheuristics to unbounded knapsack discrete problems with implementations ranging from 2D to 20D.
- Designed a neural network in PyTorch to implement heuristic algorithms as optimizers while initializing neural network weights.
- Conducted a comparative analysis of benchmark meta-heuristics for complex optimization problems.
- Analyzed data for statistical significance tests like Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, and converse test with a 0.05 p-value, alongside Q-Q plots for dataset normalization.
- Researched LLMâ€™s biases on sentiment analysis of news feeds on world crises.

## Tugposts.com
**Visit**: [Tugposts](https://www.tugposts.com)

- Developed as a one-stop online resource with extensive data compilation.
- Implemented as a Spring Boot REST application following MVC architecture.
- Designed the static HTML using JavaScript and opted for MySQL over NoSQL based on project requirements.
- Deployed on AWS using EC2, RDS, VPC, IAM, and NginX for reverse proxy setup.

## Machine Learning Project - Fake News Detection
Our goal was to predict whether news is real or fake, utilizing Python's sci-kit and nltk libraries with various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms.

[**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/05satyam/machine-leanring-small-projects) - This is one of many small implementations of machine learning projects.

## University ListServe
A ListServe project developed using multiple design patterns like composite, proxy, observer, factory, and singleton for a university's notification, message delivering, and SOS system.

## Custom WC Command Line Tool
Built a custom version of the Unix command line tool wc to calculate lines, word count, byte size, and character count for input files.

- Supports reading from standard input if no filename is specified.
- Extended functionality through factory design, allowing further expansion.

## Custom Compression Tool like Unix
Developed a tool for compressing and decompressing text files using Huffman coding, including bit manipulation for header creation and reading.

- Commands include "-c" for compression and "-d" for decompression.
- Utilized factory and singleton design patterns.

## Data Structure and Algorithm Practice
An open repository created to practice data structure questions from platforms like Leetcode and Geeks for Geeks.

- Includes solutions from external resources and open-source communities.
