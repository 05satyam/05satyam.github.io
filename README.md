- 🔭 I’m currently working on M.S. thesis @FresnoState, CA, USA in machine learning.
  - **Designed** a new meta-heuristics algorithm for complex optimization problems
  - **Thesis Topic** : Blindfolded Spider-Man Optimization: A Single-point Metaheuristic  Suitable for Continuous and Discrete Spaces

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how meta-heuristic algorithms works for optimization and can we use them to solve NP-hard problems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on software design projects, machine learning algorithm optimizations and deep learning neural nets.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding a good place to work and learn **#OpenToWork - Software Engineer**
